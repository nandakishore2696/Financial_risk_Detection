Problem Statement :

1. This project aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning to conduct risk analysis for loan default prediction in the context of a consumer finance company.
   
2. Identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their loan payments.
   
3. This analysis has to assist the company in minimizing financial losses while ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not unfairly rejected.

Tools Used : 

Python

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Powerpoint

Jupyter Notebook

Approach : 

1.Data Processing : After importing the data into the jupyter notebook, applied data preprocessing steps like cleaning and made the data ready for analysis and further for model building.

2.Utilized Exploratory Data Analysis to find patterns and extensively used matplotlib and seaborn for making Visualizations so that anyone can understand the patterns lying in the data

3.Model Building : Applied steps like outliers Handling, correlation Check,.. before building a model. Used random forest Classifier to predict what the applicant can become (defaulter or not). Evaluated the model using several evaluation metrics.

EDA Insights :

In the cash loans section the default rate is high compared to revolving loans

Males has high default rate

The applicants without car are defaulting high

As the number of children increases the default rate is increasing exponentially

Maternity leave, Unemployed applicants are defaulting in a high rate

As the education level increases, the default rate is decreasing. Lower secondary, Secondary / secondary special, Incomplete higher, Higher education, 
Academic degree -High default rate to low

Based of family status the default rate high to low in the order of Civil marriage, Single / not married, Separated, Married, Widow

Based on housing type, applicants of Rented apartment, With parents are defaulting with high rate

The default rate is high where population is low relatively, implies Tier 3 cities are with relatively more default rate, next Tier 2 and then Tier 1 where the population is low

Income to Debt ratio of the defaulters and others are almost same with 4.7

As the income increases, the default rate is decreasing

Lower Income applicants are applying for more and defaulting more compared to higher income applicants

Previously approved candidates are defaulting high and next high defaulters from previously refused applicants

days_birth, days_id_publish, days_registration, amt_annuity have high importance in decreasing order

The default rate is relatively high on applications started on Tuesday, next Wednesday and Friday

Almost no difference between the number of inquiries to the credit bureau of the defaulters and others

Conclusion/Suggestion :

By utilizing the insights from exploratory data analysis, the company should consider the risk associated with different types of applications profiles of different demographics, employments, number of enquiries to credit bureaus,..etc 

It's better to not approve the loan for high risk applications or provide the loan with higher interest rate, so that the risk is mitigated a little bit
